These are some UML designing projects in Patika.


In the application, films can be listed, sorted, and users can subscribe to the application.
Users purchase credits through the system for subscriptions.
Only subscribed users can rent films with their credits, and the cost of the rented film is deducted from their account.
Both regular users and subscribers can purchase films.
If a film is not available, it can be requested.

# Project 8

Kodluyoruz Insurance Company wants to construct a 12-story office building and equip it with the latest elevator technology. The company wants you to create a software simulator that models the operations of the elevators to see if they meet the traffic flow needs within the building.

The building will have five elevators, each capable of reaching all 12 floors. Each elevator has a capacity of approximately six adult passengers. The elevators are designed to be energy-efficient, so they only move when needed. Each elevator has its own door, floor indicator light, and control panel. The control panel includes destination buttons, door open and close buttons, and an emergency signal button.

Each floor in the building has a door for each of the five elevator shafts and an arrival bell for each door. The arrival bell indicates that the elevators have reached a floor. An indicator light above each door shows the arrival of an elevator and the direction it is moving. Each floor also has three sets of elevator call buttons.

A person calls an elevator by pressing the appropriate call button (up or down). A dispatcher assigns one of the five elevators to go to the floor where the call was made. After entering the elevator, a passenger typically presses one or more destination buttons. As the elevator moves from floor to floor, an indicator light inside the elevator informs the passengers of the elevator's position. The arrival of an elevator at a floor is indicated by the illumination of the indicator light above the outer elevator door and the ringing of the floor bell. When an elevator stops at a floor, both sets of doors automatically open for a predetermined period to allow passengers to enter and exit the elevator.

The simulator uses a "clock" to simulate the passage of real time and to timestamp and log the events that occur in the simulation. A random number generator is used to generate passengers and determine their departure and arrival floors within the simulation.
